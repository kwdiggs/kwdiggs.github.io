						<header><h2><a href="generic.html">CTSI-Global</a></h2>
						</header><p>From 2018 - 2020, I worked for CTSI-Global. I did a <u>lot</u> of work with web forms in Angular. Hydration, custom validation, etc. I also maintained/migrated multiple Angular web applications and trained an offshore dev in Chanai India.</p>
						<br>
						<p>After being hired, I delayed my start by 1 month to gain international experience in Japan. This image is me at "Tower of the Sun" statue in Osaka.</p>
						<p>I also married my wife around this time. :)</p>

						<header><h2><a href="generic.html">Mind Over Data, LLC</a></h2>
						</header><p>At this shop, I helped develop inventory software for client AOC Resins. I worked with a senior dev, and it was here I learned Angular.  "No third-party dependecies" was a requirement for this job, so I created custom UI elements such as a ComboBox with autocomplete and also sync/async (API calls) option generation. It was faster than other UI library solutions because I took a stateful, iterative approach instead of the simpler functional route. I also picked up some Razor templating skills (.NET) to create printer styles for custom reports (Yes, it was tedious).

						It was also during this time I accumulated some badges on StackOverflow for my <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/18/guru?userid=4971999"> Angular contributions.</a>

						<header><h2><a href="generic.html">Musistic, Inc.</a></h2>
						</header><p>During my senior year at university, I took on a developer-intern role at Musistic, Inc. Here, I worked in PHP's Yii framework for the main site, and WordPress for a subdomain.  I also had the opportunity to create both user-to-user messaging and notification systems, including the database design and the UI. I created a custom WordPress plugin. It was an audio file uploader that used ffmpeg for standardized encoding for the audio files that would be used in user profile pages. I also created a proof-of-concept mobile app for the Android platform at the request of my technical lead.</p>

						<header><h2><a href="generic.html">University of Memphis</a></h2>
						</header><p>I experienced quite a bit both studying at, and working for, the University of Memphis. I graduated with my computer science degree, but not before providing tech support, computer science tutoring, and even serving as the president of the swing dance club!</p>

						I also represented my school in 2 <a href="https://www.memphis.edu/cs/news_and_events/news/2015_ccsc_programming.php"> programming competitions.</a><br><br>

						I was employed by the UofM by the ITS Service Desk where I performed tech support over the phone and in the computer laboratories. Also, by the Department of Computer Science as a tutor.<br><br>

						Outside of school, I was also employed as a chess instructor for grade school student clubs across the greater Memphis area.

						</header>

						<p>I have a kid now! I have been remodelling our house (plumbing, electric, flooring, etc) and picked up skills in the "real/non-digital" world.</p>

						<p>I did a work-study with a man who built barns, and also with a carpenter. These skills tranfer well to home remodel. (It saves a lot money when you don't have to hire a specialist or pay standardized trip fees!)</p>

						<p>I also wanted to challenge myself and serve others, so I worked at the McDonalds Highland Ave location near the UofM for three months as a fry cook (I'm serious!). It was a valuable experience working a job not for money or career prospects, but because I chose to. I was also able to consider the supply chain and work processes/algortihms for food preparation that were used, and how they worked together.</p>
